## 💡 Why I Built This

YouTube holds massive educational and cultural value — but structured extraction of information is often frustrating. I built this app to:

- Automate metadata retrieval
- Simplify downloading in ethical, user-controlled ways
- Offer a clean alternative to ad-ridden tools

This reflects my interests in:

- 📊 Data analysis  
- 🧩 Problem-solving with Python  
- 🧠 Media studies & information accessibility  
- 💻 GUI design and digital literacy

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- `Python 3.11+`  
- `pytube` – for metadata & downloads  
- `tkinter` – GUI interface  
- `pydub` – (optional) audio conversion  
- `threading`, `datetime`, `os` – core functionality  
- `pyinstaller` – for .exe packaging  
- `matplotlib` – (optional) visual stats
